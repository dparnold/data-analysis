# data-analysis

This is a collection of data analysis/representation tools.
- listDensityPlot is creating a density plot or heatmap of three arrays x,y and z, where the touple (x[i], y[i], z[i]) is one measurement. This could for instance be the temperature z at a point (x,y) of a surface. This function is the python implementation of the Mathematica function with the same name.
